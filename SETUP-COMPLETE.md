# 🚀 Agent Workspace Setup Complete!

Your PRPs Agentic Engineering workspace has been successfully configured with the distributed agent coordination system.

## ✅ What Was Set Up

### 1. **Agent Coordination System** (`.agent-system/`)
- **Task Registry**: Centralized lightweight JSON task tracking
- **Session Management**: Multi-session coordination with lock files
- **Agent Contexts**: Individual agent workspaces with minimal context loading
- **Sync Mechanism**: Cross-agent communication via broadcasts and handoffs

### 2. **Workspace Structure** (`workspace/`)
- **Features**: Feature-based development organization
- **Fixes**: Hotfix and patch management
- **Shared**: Reusable components and libraries

### 3. **Planning & Documentation** (`PRPs/`)
- **Cache System**: Agent-specific views to minimize context (2-5KB vs 50KB+)
- **Organized Sections**: planning, architecture, contracts, security
- **Task Briefs**: Extracted lightweight task descriptions

### 4. **Integration & Deployment** (`integration/`)
- **Environments**: local, staging, production configurations
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions and Jenkins pipeline support
- **Monitoring**: Dashboard configurations

### 5. **Helper Scripts** (`scripts/`)
- `agent-task-manager.py`: Task assignment and tracking
- `generate-agent-views.py`: Lightweight context generation
- `complete-setup.py`: Workspace initialization

## 🎯 Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Initialize Your First Project

```bash
# In Claude Code, start with:
/prime-core

# Then load the orchestration framework:
"Load AGENT-ORCHESTRATION.md and initialize all agents for a new project: [your project name]"
```

### Step 2: Create Your First Task

```bash
# Using the task manager:
python scripts/agent-task-manager.py create \
  --title "Implement user authentication" \
  --priority high \
  --hours 8

# This creates TASK-001
```

### Step 3: Agent Claims Task

```bash
# Implementation specialist claims the task:
python scripts/agent-task-manager.py claim \
  --agent implementation-specialist \
  --task TASK-001
```

### Step 4: Generate Lightweight Views

```bash
# Generate agent-specific views to minimize context:
python scripts/generate-agent-views.py --all

# This creates 2-5KB views instead of loading 50KB+ documents
```

### Step 5: Check Status

```bash
# View overall status:
python scripts/agent-task-manager.py status

# View specific task:
python scripts/agent-task-manager.py status --task TASK-001
```

## 📊 Key Features

### 1. **Minimal Context Loading**
- Agents only load their specific views (~5KB)
- Task-specific briefs extract only relevant sections
- Dynamic loading based on current phase and task

### 2. **Parallel Work Support**
- Lock-free task claiming with session tracking
- Multiple agents can work on different features simultaneously
- Clear handoff protocol between agents

### 3. **Technology Agnostic**
- Feature-based organization works with any stack
- Automatic stack detection for Python, Java, JavaScript, TypeScript
- Extensible to any technology

### 4. **Complete Audit Trail**
- Every agent maintains their own changelog
- Session history tracks all work
- Task registry maintains complete status

## 🔧 Configuration Files

### Task Registry (`.agent-system/registry/tasks.json`)
```json
{
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "tasks": {
    "TASK-001": {
      "title": "Task title",
      "status": "pending|in-progress|completed|blocked",
      "agent": "assigned-agent-name",
      "priority": "critical|high|medium|low"
    }
  }
}
```

### Context Loader (`.claude/context-loader.yaml`)
Defines what each agent loads:
- `always_load`: Files loaded every time
- `conditional_load`: Files loaded based on conditions
- `never_load`: Files explicitly excluded
- `max_context_tokens`: Token limit per agent

## 🚦 Workflow Types

### Standard Workflow (7 phases)
- Full process for complex features
- All agents involved
- 1-2 weeks duration

### Hotfix Workflow
- Emergency fixes
- 2-4 hours
- Minimal agent involvement

### Small Feature
- Features < 1 day
- 3-4 agents
- Simplified process

### Research Task
- Technical investigations
- Variable duration
- Research-focused agents

## 📝 Next Steps

1. **Load Agent Orchestration**:
   ```
   "Load AGENT-ORCHESTRATION.md to understand the full process"
   ```

2. **Review Agent Library**:
   ```
   "Review .claude/agents/*.md to understand each agent's role"
   ```

3. **Start Your Project**:
   ```
   "PRP Orchestrator, initiate standard workflow for [your project]"
   ```

## 🎉 You're Ready!

Your workspace is now configured for efficient parallel agent development with minimal context loading. Each agent can work independently while maintaining full system awareness through the lightweight registry.

### Key Commands to Remember:
- **Initialize**: `/prime-core`
- **Create Task**: `python scripts/agent-task-manager.py create --title "..."`
- **Claim Task**: `python scripts/agent-task-manager.py claim --agent ... --task ...`
- **Check Status**: `python scripts/agent-task-manager.py status`
- **Generate Views**: `python scripts/generate-agent-views.py --all`
