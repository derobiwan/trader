# Planning PRD: LLM-Powered Crypto Trading System MVP

## Purpose
Design and specify an automated cryptocurrency trading system that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to make trading decisions based on technical analysis, with 3-minute execution intervals and multi-model support through OpenRouter.

## Initial Concept
Build a Python-based trading system that:
- Invokes LLM agents every 3 minutes with market data
- Supports multiple LLM models through unified API (OpenRouter)
- Executes trades on perpetual futures for 6 cryptocurrencies
- Manages risk through position sizing and stop-loss conditions
- Provides monitoring and performance tracking

      - Must handle 6 concurrent positions
      - LLM token costs consideration
      - Exchange API rate limits
    - integration_points:
      - Exchange APIs (Binance, Bybit, etc.)
      - OpenRouter/LLM provider APIs
      - Market data feeds
      - Monitoring/alerting systems
```

#### Initial Exploration
```
RESEARCH implementation approaches:
  - Event-driven vs. polling architecture
  - Synchronous vs. asynchronous LLM calls
  - Position state management patterns
  - Risk calculation methodologies

ANALYZE technical requirements:
  - Latency requirements (< 1 second for decisions)
  - Data freshness (real-time vs. 3-minute snapshots)
  - Fault tolerance (API failures, network issues)
  - Scalability (multiple trading pairs/strategies)
```

### Phase 2: PRD Structure Generation

#### 1. Executive Summary

```markdown
## Problem Statement
Cryptocurrency traders need a system that can consistently execute technical analysis-based trading strategies 24/7 without emotional bias, while adapting to market conditions using advanced AI reasoning capabilities. Current solutions either lack AI integration or require extensive manual configuration.

## Solution Overview
An automated trading system that leverages Large Language Models to analyze market data every 3 minutes, make informed trading decisions based on technical indicators, and execute trades with proper risk management. The system supports multiple LLM providers through a unified interface and provides comprehensive position tracking and performance analytics.

## Success Metrics
- Decision Latency: < 2 seconds per trading cycle
- System Uptime: > 99.5% availability
- Risk Compliance: 100% adherence to stop-loss rules
- Profitability: Positive Sharpe Ratio > 0.5
- LLM Cost Efficiency: < $100/month for continuous operation
```

    - risk: "LLM response inconsistency"
      mitigation: "Implement strict JSON schema validation and retry logic"
    
    - risk: "Exchange API rate limits"
      mitigation: "Use WebSocket for data, batch operations, implement backoff"
    
    - risk: "Network latency affecting 3-minute cycles"
      mitigation: "Async processing, parallel API calls, timeout management"
    
    - risk: "Database performance at high frequency"
      mitigation: "Time-series database for market data, indexing strategy"
  
  business_risks:
    - risk: "LLM costs exceeding budget"
      mitigation: "Token usage monitoring, prompt optimization, model selection"
    
    - risk: "Regulatory compliance"
      mitigation: "Audit logging, position limits, user agreements"
    
    - risk: "Capital loss from bad decisions"
      mitigation: "Paper trading mode, position limits, daily loss limits"
  
  edge_cases:
    - scenario: "Market flash crash"
      handling: "Circuit breaker triggers, all positions to safety mode"
    
    - scenario: "LLM returns buy and sell for same asset"
      handling: "Precedence rules, conflict resolution logic"
    
    - scenario: "Exchange maintenance during trading"
      handling: "Fallback to other exchanges, pause trading, alert operator"
    
    - scenario: "Partial order fills"
      handling: "Position reconciliation, adjust or cancel remaining"
```
