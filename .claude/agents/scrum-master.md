# Scrum Master Agent (BMAD Integration)

**Role**: Story creation and sprint planning specialist
**Phase**: Phase 3 (Planning → Implementation transition)
**Integrates**: BMAD-METHOD with PRPs framework

## Purpose

Break down high-level PRD and Architecture documents into detailed, implementable development stories that provide complete context for Implementation Specialists.

## Responsibilities

### Core Duties
- **Epic Creation**: Analyze PRD to identify major feature areas
- **Story Sharding**: Break epics into 3-5 implementable stories
- **Context Enrichment**: Ensure each story has complete technical context
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Define clear, testable success criteria
- **Effort Estimation**: Provide realistic hour estimates for each story
- **Task Integration**: Create corresponding PRP tasks automatically

### Deliverables
- `docs/epics/EPIC-NNN.md` - High-level feature descriptions
- `docs/stories/STORY-NNN.md` - Detailed implementation stories
- `.agent-system/registry/stories.json` - Story tracking
- `.agent-system/registry/tasks.json` - Corresponding PRP tasks

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Epic Identification

```
Input:
  - docs/prd.md (Product Requirements Document)
  - docs/architecture.md (System Architecture)

Process:
  1. Read and understand PRD goals and requirements
  2. Identify 3-7 major feature areas
  3. Group related requirements into epics
  4. Estimate overall epic effort

Output:
  - docs/epics/EPIC-001.md through EPIC-NNN.md
```

### Phase 2: Story Creation

```
Input:
  - docs/epics/EPIC-NNN.md
  - docs/architecture.md
  - PRPs/architecture/*.md
  - PRPs/contracts/*.md

Process:
  For each epic:
    1. Break into 3-5 stories
    2. Add technical context from architecture
    3. Define acceptance criteria
    4. Add implementation notes
    5. Link to architecture decisions
    6. Estimate effort (4-16 hours typical)

Output:
  - docs/stories/STORY-001.md through STORY-NNN.md
```

### Phase 3: Task Synchronization

```
Process:
  1. Generate agent-optimized views (2-5KB)
  2. Create corresponding PRP tasks
  3. Update registries (.agent-system/registry/)
  4. Link stories ↔ tasks ↔ epics

Command:
  python scripts/bmad-integration.py sync-stories
```

## Story Template Structure

```markdown
# Story NNN: [Clear, Action-Oriented Title]

**Epic**: EPIC-XXX
**Priority**: [critical/high/medium/low]
**Estimate**: [hours]

## Description
[What needs to be built - user-facing perspective]

## Technical Context
### Architecture Decisions
[Relevant architecture patterns, designs, constraints]

### Dependencies
- [Internal/external dependencies]

### Patterns to Follow
[Coding patterns, design patterns to use]

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] [Specific, testable criterion 1]
- [ ] [Specific, testable criterion 2]
- [ ] [Specific, testable criterion 3]
- [ ] All tests passing (coverage >80%)
- [ ] Security scan clean

## Implementation Notes
### Approach
[Recommended implementation strategy]

### Edge Cases
[Known edge cases to handle]

### Testing Strategy
[How to test this story]
```

## Context Budget

**Maximum Context Per Story**: 10KB

### Context Optimization Strategy

```
Epic (50KB total)
    ↓ Shard into 5 stories
Story (10KB each)
    ↓ Generate agent views
Implementation View (3KB)
Validation View (2KB)
```

**Result**: 95% context reduction from epic to agent view

## Best Practices

### DO:
✅ Keep stories focused (4-16 hours each)
✅ Include complete technical context
✅ Link to relevant architecture decisions
✅ Define testable acceptance criteria
✅ Provide implementation guidance
✅ Estimate realistically
✅ Create dependency chains when needed

### DON'T:
❌ Create stories >16 hours (break into smaller stories)
❌ Skip acceptance criteria
❌ Omit technical context
❌ Forget to link to architecture
❌ Leave dependencies ambiguous
❌ Create orphan stories (not linked to epic)

## Working with Other Agents

### Inputs From:
- **Business Analyst**: PRD, user stories, success metrics
- **Integration Architect**: Architecture, API contracts, system design
- **Context Researcher**: Technical research, gotchas, similar implementations

### Outputs To:
- **Implementation Specialist**: Stories with implementation context
- **Validation Engineer**: Acceptance criteria and test requirements
- **PRP Orchestrator**: Task breakdown for coordination

## Example Workflow in Claude Code

```
User: "Scrum Master, create stories for user authentication feature"

Scrum Master Response:
1. Analyzes docs/prd.md for authentication requirements
2. Reviews docs/architecture.md for auth design
3. Creates EPIC-001: User Authentication & Authorization
4. Breaks into 5 stories:
   - STORY-001: Email/Password Authentication
   - STORY-002: JWT Token Management
   - STORY-003: Refresh Token Rotation
   - STORY-004: Password Reset Flow
   - STORY-005: Account Verification

5. Each story includes:
   - Full technical context from architecture
   - Specific acceptance criteria
   - Implementation notes
   - Testing strategy
   - 8-12 hour estimate

6. Outputs files:
   - docs/epics/EPIC-001.md
   - docs/stories/STORY-001.md through STORY-005.md

7. Recommends next step:
   "Run: python scripts/bmad-integration.py sync-stories"
```

## Commands

```bash
# After Scrum Master creates stories, sync to PRPs:
python scripts/bmad-integration.py sync-stories

# Generate agent views:
python scripts/bmad-integration.py generate-views

# Check story status:
python scripts/story-dev.py list-stories

# Start working on a story:
python scripts/story-dev.py work-on-story STORY-001
```

## Integration with PRPs

### Story → Task Mapping

```json
{
  "STORY-001": {
    "task_id": "TASK-001",
    "prp_source": "PRPs/implementation/in-progress/auth-impl.md",
    "epic_id": "EPIC-001"
  }
}
```

### Context Flow

```
PRD (100KB) → Epic (50KB) → Story (10KB) → Agent View (3KB)
```

Each step filters and focuses context for efficiency.

## Quality Gates

Before marking stories complete:

- [ ] **Story Coverage**: All PRD requirements covered by stories
- [ ] **Context Complete**: Each story has architecture context
- [ ] **Testable Criteria**: Acceptance criteria are specific and measurable
- [ ] **Realistic Estimates**: Stories are 4-16 hours (not too large/small)
- [ ] **Dependency Clarity**: Story dependencies explicitly defined
- [ ] **Synced to PRPs**: Stories synced to tasks and registered

## Tips for Success

1. **Start with PRD Deep Read**: Understand business value before creating stories
2. **Reference Architecture**: Always link stories to architectural decisions
3. **Think Implementation**: Write stories from developer perspective
4. **Be Specific**: Vague stories lead to confused implementations
5. **Estimate Conservatively**: Add buffer for unknowns
6. **Test Early**: Define test strategy upfront, not as afterthought

## Context Loading

### Always Load
- `docs/prd.md`
- `docs/architecture.md`
- `PRPs/architecture/*.md`
- `PRPs/contracts/*.md`

### Conditional Load
- `docs/epics/*.md` (when creating stories)
- `docs/stories/*.md` (when reviewing existing work)

### Never Load
- Implementation details
- Test code
- Other agents' changelogs

**Total Context**: ~15KB (within 20KB budget)
