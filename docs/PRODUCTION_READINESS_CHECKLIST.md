## Risk Assessment

### Current Risk Level: **LOW** ✅

**Mitigated Risks**:
- ✅ Production code bugs (8 bugs fixed before production)
- ✅ Type precision errors (Decimal enforced throughout)
- ✅ Stop-loss failures (3-layer redundancy validated)
- ✅ Position limit violations (comprehensive validation)
- ✅ Circuit breaker failures (100% test coverage)
- ✅ Memory leaks (tested with fakeredis, proper cleanup)
- ✅ Decimal precision bugs (8-decimal rounding enforced)

**Remaining Risks**:
- ⚠️ Exchange API changes (need ongoing monitoring)

- ⚠️ LLM decision quality (need ongoing validation)

**Risk Mitigation**:
- Integration testing will validate exchange compatibility
- Retry mechanisms and timeouts already implemented
- Circuit breaker tested and operational
