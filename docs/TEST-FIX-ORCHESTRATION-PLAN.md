# Test Failure Fix Initiative - Orchestration Plan

**Date**: 2025-10-31
**Orchestrator**: PRP Orchestrator
**Goal**: Fix 158 failing tests to achieve 100% test pass rate

## Executive Summary

This orchestration plan coordinates 4 parallel fix teams to address 158 failing tests across the codebase. Based on initial analysis, failures are categorized into distinct patterns that can be efficiently resolved through specialized workstreams.

## Current State Analysis

### Test Statistics
- **Total Tests**: 1,062
- **Passing**: 904 (85%)
- **Failing**: 158 (15%)
- **Target**: 100% pass rate

### Failure Root Cause Analysis

#### Category 1: Async/Concurrency Issues (37 failures)
- **Location**: Redis manager, async fixtures
- **Pattern**: Context manager protocol errors, async/await misuse
- **Example**: `TypeError: 'async_generator' object does not support asynchronous context manager`
- **Complexity**: Medium-High
- **Time Estimate**: 3-4 hours

#### Category 2: Type Consistency Issues (~50 failures)
- **Location**: Trade executor, market data, risk manager
- **Pattern**: Decimal vs float mismatches, type validation errors
- **Example**: Pydantic validation failing on numeric types
- **Complexity**: Low-Medium
- **Time Estimate**: 1-2 hours

#### Category 3: Mock/Fixture Issues (~40 failures)
- **Location**: Database tests, API tests, integration tests
- **Pattern**: Incorrect mock setup, missing fixtures, import errors
- **Example**: fakeredis not properly initialized, SQLAlchemy session issues
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Time Estimate**: 2-3 hours

#### Category 4: Integration/Timing Issues (~31 failures)
- **Location**: WebSocket tests, circuit breaker, security scanner
- **Pattern**: Race conditions, timeout issues, external dependency mocks
- **Complexity**: High
- **Time Estimate**: 3-4 hours

## Coordination Protocol

### Communication Channel
All teams report progress via:
1. Update changelog in `.agent-system/agents/{agent-name}/changelog.md`
2. Mark fixed tests in shared tracking document
3. Create fix summary for each category

### Handoff Points
1. **Alpha → Delta**: Async fixes complete, ready for verification
2. **Bravo → Delta**: Type fixes complete, ready for verification
3. **Charlie → Delta**: Integration fixes complete, ready for verification
4. **Delta → Orchestrator**: Final report with 100% pass confirmation

### Conflict Resolution
- If teams encounter overlapping fixes, prioritize by failure count
- Use git branches for parallel work: `fix/team-{alpha|bravo|charlie|delta}`
- Merge conflicts resolved by Implementation Specialist lead

## Success Metrics

### Phase 1 Success (2 hours)
- [ ] Environment configuration fixed
- [ ] Import errors resolved
- [ ] Basic type issues fixed
- [ ] 60+ tests now passing

### Phase 2 Success (5 hours)
- [ ] All async/Redis tests passing
- [ ] All type consistency issues resolved
- [ ] Integration mocks properly configured
- [ ] 120+ additional tests passing

### Phase 3 Success (7 hours)

## Risk Mitigation

### Identified Risks
1. **Complex async patterns** may require architecture changes
   - Mitigation: Implementation Specialist has fallback patterns ready
2. **Database mock complexity** may slow integration fixes
   - Mitigation: Use in-memory SQLite for complex scenarios
3. **Circular dependencies** may require refactoring
   - Mitigation: Create interface abstractions if needed

### Contingency Plans
- If Phase 2 extends beyond 5 hours, activate additional Implementation Specialist
- If coverage remains <80%, create follow-up test generation sprint
- If flaky tests persist, implement retry decorators with exponential backoff

## Final Deliverables

1. **Test Execution Report**
   - Full pytest report with 100% pass rate
   - Coverage report showing improvements
   - Performance metrics for test execution time

2. **Fix Summary Document**
   - Categorized list of all fixes applied
   - Patterns identified and resolved
   - Recommendations for preventing regression

3. **Updated Test Guidelines**
   - Best practices for async testing
   - Type consistency standards
   - Mock setup patterns

## Activation Sequence

Execute in this order:
1. Create team branches: `git checkout -b fix/team-{name}`
2. Launch Teams Bravo and Charlie immediately (parallel)
3. Launch Team Alpha after 30 minutes (dependencies on initial fixes)
4. Launch Team Delta at Phase 3 start
5. Merge all branches after verification
