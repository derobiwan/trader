## 🔄 Dependencies & Coordination

### Critical Dependencies
1. **Alpha → Bravo**: Risk manager tests depend on executor service mocks
2. **Charlie → Delta**: Scheduler tests need market data mocks
3. **All → Integration**: Final integration requires all teams complete

### Parallel Work Opportunities
- Alpha and Bravo can work simultaneously (Day 1)
- Charlie and Delta can work simultaneously (Day 2-3)
- Echo can start early on historical data tests

## 🚨 Risk Mitigation

### Identified Risks
1. **Exchange API Mocking Complexity**: Prepare comprehensive mock responses
2. **WebSocket Testing**: Use recorded streams for reproducibility
3. **Time-based Tests**: Implement time control utilities
4. **Redis Dependencies**: Use testcontainers or embedded Redis

### Contingency Plans
- If behind schedule: Focus on P1 components only
- If blocked: Escalate to Context Researcher for investigation
- If flaky tests: Implement retry mechanisms with clear logging
