## Key Business Insights Discovered

### 1. Stakeholder Priorities
- **System Owner/Trader**: Profitability with controlled risk is paramount
- **Risk Manager**: 100% stop-loss adherence is non-negotiable
- **System Operator**: Stability and clear error messages are critical
- **Performance Analyst**: Complete audit trail and accurate metrics are essential

### 2. Critical Success Factors
1. **Risk Management First**: Stop-loss adherence is the #1 priority (zero tolerance)
2. **Cost Control**: LLM budget of $100/month must be strictly enforced
3. **Reliability**: 99.5% uptime required for 24/7 trading operations
4. **Decision Speed**: <2 second latency to capture opportunities in 3-minute cycles
5. **Auditability**: Complete decision trail for compliance and debugging

### 3. Business Value Quantification
- **Time Savings**: 2,920 hours/year eliminated ($146,000 equivalent value)
- **Opportunity Capture**: 48x more decisions per day (480 vs 10 manual)
- **Risk Reduction**: 30% improvement in stop-loss adherence (70% → 100%)
- **ROI**: 289% first-year return (excluding time value), 3.1-month payback period
- **Net Benefit**: $5,200-$7,950/year after costs in base case scenario

### 4. Risk Mitigation Priorities
- **Daily Loss Limit**: -5% circuit breaker prevents catastrophic losses
- **Position Exposure**: 80% max exposure prevents over-leverage
- **Leverage Limits**: 5-40x range prevents excessive risk-taking
- **API Key Security**: AES-256 encryption mandatory, no withdrawal permissions
- **Emergency Shutdown**: Panic button for critical situations

### 5. Edge Cases Requiring Special Attention
- **Flash Crash Scenario**: Circuit breaker must trigger, close all positions
- **LLM Conflicting Signals**: Precedence rules (Close > Sell > Buy > Hold)
- **Exchange Maintenance**: Multi-exchange support, graceful degradation
- **Partial Order Fills**: Accept partial positions >50%, reject below
- **Position Without Stop-Loss**: Immediate closure, critical alert

---

## Recommendations for Phase 2 (Architecture)

### 1. Immediate Next Steps
1. **Context Researcher** should investigate:
   - Existing patterns in codebase for similar async processing
   - Database schema design best practices for time-series financial data
   - Security patterns for API key management
   - Error handling and retry logic patterns

2. **Integration Architect** should design:
   - API contracts between services (Market Data → Decision Engine → Executor)
   - Database schema for positions, market_data, trading_signals, audit_logs
   - LLM provider abstraction layer (support OpenRouter + direct APIs)
   - WebSocket architecture for real-time market data

3. **Security Auditor** should review:
   - API key encryption and storage approach
   - Audit log immutability guarantees
   - Exchange API permission requirements (trade-only, no withdrawals)
   - Sensitive data redaction in logs

### 2. Technical Decisions Required
1. **Database Choice**: PostgreSQL confirmed, consider TimescaleDB extension for time-series data
2. **Cache Strategy**: Redis for market data cache and real-time metrics
3. **Task Scheduling**: Celery with Redis for 3-minute cycle execution
4. **LLM Integration**: OpenRouter as primary, with direct API fallbacks
5. **Monitoring Stack**: Prometheus + Grafana vs. custom dashboard (decide based on requirements)

### 3. Architecture Priorities
1. **Stop-Loss Enforcement**: Architectural guarantee (no position without stop-loss)
2. **Idempotency**: All operations must be idempotent (handle retries safely)
3. **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: For LLM API, Exchange API, Database
4. **Graceful Degradation**: System continues operating with reduced functionality on partial failures
5. **Audit Trail**: Append-only logs, immutable, complete decision context

### 4. Non-Functional Requirements Focus
- **Latency Budget**: 2-second total budget requires aggressive optimization:
  - Market data fetch: 500ms
  - Indicator calculation: 200ms
  - LLM API call: 1000ms
  - Parsing + validation: 150ms
- **Concurrency**: Parallel processing of 6 cryptocurrencies required
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive retry logic with exponential backoff
- **Observability**: Structured logging, metric instrumentation at every layer

### 5. Validation Gates for Architecture Phase
Before proceeding to implementation, architecture must address:
- [ ] How is 100% stop-loss adherence architecturally guaranteed?
- [ ] How does system handle LLM API timeout during trading cycle?
- [ ] What happens if database connection is lost mid-cycle?
- [ ] How is position reconciliation implemented (system vs. exchange)?
- [ ] What is the rollback strategy if deployment fails?

## Open Questions for Stakeholder Clarification

### Business Questions
1. **Initial Capital Allocation**: What is the recommended initial trading capital? (PRD assumes $10,000 minimum)
2. **Risk Appetite**: Is -5% daily loss limit appropriate, or should it be more/less conservative?
3. **Model Selection**: Which LLM models should be configured as primary and backup? (Cost vs. performance tradeoff)
4. **Trading Hours**: Should system trade 24/7 or pause during certain hours? (e.g., low liquidity periods)
5. **Position Replacement**: Should system automatically close worst-performing position when limit reached and new high-confidence signal arrives?

### Technical Questions
1. **Exchange Selection**: Primary exchange (Binance, Bybit, or multi-exchange from start)?
2. **Infrastructure**: Self-hosted VPS or managed cloud (AWS, GCP, Azure)?
3. **Backup Strategy**: RTO/RPO requirements for disaster recovery?
4. **Monitoring**: Build custom dashboard or use Grafana + Prometheus?
5. **Paper Trading Duration**: 7 days minimum acceptable or longer validation period required?

## Risks & Concerns Identified

### High-Priority Risks
1. **LLM Cost Overrun**: Token usage could exceed budget if prompts not optimized
   - Mitigation: Implement cost monitoring with automatic model downgrade at 70% budget

2. **Stop-Loss Placement Failure**: Technical failure could leave position unprotected
   - Mitigation: If stop-loss placement fails, immediately close position at market (no exceptions)

3. **Position Reconciliation**: System and exchange positions could diverge
   - Mitigation: 30-minute reconciliation cycle, exchange is source of truth

4. **LLM Response Quality**: Model could return poor trading decisions
   - Mitigation: Paper trading validation period, confidence thresholding, model performance tracking

5. **Exchange API Changes**: Exchange could change API without notice
   - Mitigation: Use ccxt library abstraction, version pinning, monitoring for API errors

### Medium-Priority Risks
1. **Data Quality Issues**: Market data could be corrupted or delayed
2. **Partial Order Fills**: Positions may not execute at desired size
3. **Network Latency**: Could cause decision latency SLA breach
4. **Database Performance**: High-frequency writes could cause bottlenecks
5. **Alert Fatigue**: Too many false alarms could cause operator to ignore critical alerts

3. **Decision Latency**: Must be <2s average (affects ability to capture opportunities)
4. **Sharpe Ratio**: Must be >0.3 after 7-day paper trading (>0.5 for production)

### For Operational Health
1. **Cycle Success Rate**: >99% indicates system stability
2. **MTTR**: <3 minutes indicates good recovery procedures
3. **Error Rate**: <1 critical error per 1000 ops indicates code quality

### For Cost Management
1. **LLM Cost Per Decision**: <$0.01 average (indicates prompt optimization)
2. **Cost Per Trade**: <$5 (indicates overall cost efficiency)
