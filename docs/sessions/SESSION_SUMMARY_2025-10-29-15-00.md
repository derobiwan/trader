## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risk: LOW ✅
- All core features tested and working
- Infrastructure code complete
- Deployment procedures documented
- Rollback mechanisms in place

### Timeline Risk: MEDIUM ⚠️
- Dependent on infrastructure provisioning (4-6 hours)
- 7-day paper trading is non-negotiable
- Any critical bugs during validation could extend timeline

### Production Risk: LOW ✅
- Comprehensive testing completed (254 tests)
- Security scanning passing
- Load testing validated (1000+ cycles/day)
- Monitoring and alerting configured
