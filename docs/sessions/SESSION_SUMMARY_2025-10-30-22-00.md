## Code Quality

### Standards Followed

- ✓ Async/await for all I/O operations
- ✓ Configuration via environment variables and config classes
- ✓ Dataclasses for structured data
- ✓ Enum classes for type safety
- ✓ CLI interfaces for standalone testing

### Design Patterns
- ✓ Consistent with existing codebase patterns (query_optimizer, cache_warmer)
- ✓ Separation of concerns (config, execution, reporting)
- ✓ Builder pattern for configuration
- ✓ Factory pattern for metric creation
- ✓ Context manager pattern for resource management
- ✓ Strategy pattern for different test types

### Dependencies
All required packages are standard or commonly available:

   - Secret detection uses regex patterns (may have false positives)

2. **Load Testing Framework**:
   - Simulates trading cycles (requires actual implementations for real testing)
   - Resource monitoring accuracy depends on psutil
   - Peak throughput calculation uses 10-second windows

3. **Penetration Testing Suite**:
   - Requires target system to be running
   - Safe mode prevents destructive operations
   - Some tests may trigger security alerts in production

4. **Performance Benchmarks**:
   - Requires database and cache connections for full testing
   - Memory benchmark results vary by system
   - Baseline comparison requires previous runs
