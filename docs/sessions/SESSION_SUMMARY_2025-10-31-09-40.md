# Session Summary: WebSocket Test Fixes
**Date**: 2025-10-31 09:40
**Team**: Fix-Delta (Implementation Specialist)
**Focus**: WebSocket and timing-related test failures

## Objective
Fix 3 failing tests related to WebSocket timing issues, race conditions, and event loop management.

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. test_consecutive_unhealthy_checks
**Issue**: Health check was not incrementing `consecutive_unhealthy_checks` counter when no messages had been received yet.

**Root Cause**: In `websocket_health.py` line 163-165, the function returned `False` immediately when no messages were received, but did not increment the counter.

**Fix**: Added `self.metrics.consecutive_unhealthy_checks += 1` before returning `False`.

**File**: `/Users/tobiprivat/Documents/GitProjects/personal/trader/workspace/features/market_data/websocket_health.py`

```python
# Line 163-166
if not self.last_message_time:
    self.metrics.consecutive_unhealthy_checks += 1  # Added this line
    logger.debug("Health check: No messages received yet")
    return False
```

### 2. test_uptime_calculation_with_downtime
**Issue**: Uptime calculation was returning negative percentage (-4821.74%) due to test setting unrealistic downtime (5 seconds) while only waiting 0.1 seconds.

**Root Cause**:
1. Implementation didn't guard against negative uptime values
2. Test had incorrect expectations

**Fixes**:
1. **Implementation fix** in `websocket_reconnection.py` lines 45-47: Added guard to ensure uptime is never negative
2. **Test fix** in `test_websocket_reconnection.py` line 47: Changed downtime from 5.0 seconds to 0.05 seconds to match the 0.1 second wait

**File 1**: `/Users/tobiprivat/Documents/GitProjects/personal/trader/workspace/features/market_data/websocket_reconnection.py`
```python
# Lines 43-49
uptime_time = total_time - self.total_downtime_seconds

# Ensure uptime is not negative due to timing issues
if uptime_time < 0:
    uptime_time = 0.0

return (uptime_time / total_time) * 100.0
```

**File 2**: `/Users/tobiprivat/Documents/GitProjects/personal/trader/workspace/tests/unit/test_websocket_reconnection.py`
```python
# Line 47
stats.total_downtime_seconds = 0.05  # Changed from 5.0 to 0.05 (50ms downtime)
```

### 3. test_multiple_reconnection_cycles
**Issue**: `stats.total_attempts` was being reset to 0 on each `connect_with_retry()` call, so multiple reconnection cycles didn't accumulate the total attempts count correctly.

**Root Cause**: Line 137 in `websocket_reconnection.py` was resetting `self.stats.total_attempts = 0` at the start of each connection attempt.

**Fix**: Removed the line that resets `total_attempts` to 0, allowing it to accumulate across multiple reconnection cycles.

**File**: `/Users/tobiprivat/Documents/GitProjects/personal/trader/workspace/features/market_data/websocket_reconnection.py`

```python
# Line 141 - Removed the following line:
# self.stats.total_attempts = 0
```

## Test Results

### Before Fixes
- **test_websocket_health.py**: 25/26 passing (1 failure)
- **test_websocket_reconnection.py**: 19/21 passing (2 failures)
- **Total**: 44/47 passing

### After Fixes
- **test_websocket_health.py**: 26/26 passing ✅
- **test_websocket_reconnection.py**: 21/21 passing ✅
- **Total**: 47/47 passing ✅

### Consistency Testing
Ran tests 5 times consecutively:
- Run 1: 47 passed ✅
- Run 2: 47 passed ✅
- Run 3: 47 passed ✅
- Run 4: 47 passed ✅
- Run 5: 47 passed ✅

**Result**: Tests are deterministic and pass consistently.

## Files Modified

1. `/Users/tobiprivat/Documents/GitProjects/personal/trader/workspace/features/market_data/websocket_health.py`
   - Added consecutive unhealthy checks increment

2. `/Users/tobiprivat/Documents/GitProjects/personal/trader/workspace/features/market_data/websocket_reconnection.py`
   - Added guard for negative uptime calculation
   - Removed total_attempts reset

3. `/Users/tobiprivat/Documents/GitProjects/personal/trader/workspace/tests/unit/test_websocket_reconnection.py`
   - Fixed test expectations for downtime calculation

## Success Criteria Met
- ✅ All WebSocket health tests passing (26/26)
- ✅ All WebSocket reconnection tests passing (21/21)
- ✅ No timing-dependent failures
- ✅ No race conditions
- ✅ Tests run deterministically
- ✅ 47 tests now passing (previously 44)

## Notes
- The fixes addressed logic bugs rather than timing issues
- No need for time mocking (freezegun) as tests were already deterministic
- All fixes maintain backward compatibility
- No changes to public APIs

## Next Steps
None required - all issues resolved and tests passing consistently.
