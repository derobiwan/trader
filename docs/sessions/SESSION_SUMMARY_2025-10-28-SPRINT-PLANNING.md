# Session Summary: Sprint Planning for Parallel Agent Execution

**Date**: 2025-10-28
**Session Type**: Sprint Planning & Agent Coordination
**Status**: ✅ Complete
**Deliverables**: Sprint 1 complete planning (5 files, 2,500+ lines)

## 📋 Session Overview

Created comprehensive sprint planning documents to enable **4 Claude Code agents to work in parallel** on Sprint 1 tasks. Each agent receives a detailed implementation guide with code snippets, test cases, and validation steps.

**Goal**: Enable parallel execution of 30+ pending tasks by multiple agents without conflicts

**Approach**:
- Group tasks by dependencies (no blocking within sprint)
- Create 4 independent work streams
- Provide complete implementation guides
- Define clear file boundaries

**Total Effort**: 12 hours

**Task**:
**TASK-013**: Position reconciliation system (12h)
- Continuous position sync with exchange (5-minute interval)
- Detect 4 discrepancy types:
  - Position missing in system (CRITICAL)
  - Position missing on exchange (WARNING)
  - Quantity mismatch (INFO/WARNING/CRITICAL based on %)
  - Side mismatch (CRITICAL)
- Auto-correction for minor discrepancies
- Critical alerts for manual intervention

**Reconciliation Logic**:
- Tolerance thresholds:
  - Quantity: 1% (auto-correct < 10%, alert > 10%)
  - Price: 0.1% (auto-correct)
  - Side: None (always CRITICAL)

**Auto-Correction Rules**:
- Position closed on exchange → Close in system
- Quantity mismatch < 10% → Update system
- Price mismatch → Update entry price

**Safety Features**:
- Critical discrepancies trigger immediate alerts
- Side mismatch requires manual verification
- Comprehensive logging of all actions

## 🎓 Key Design Decisions

### 1. Independent Work Streams
**Decision**: Group tasks to eliminate dependencies within sprint
**Rationale**: Enable true parallel execution by 4 agents
**Impact**: 3x speedup (41h → 14h)

### 2. Complete Code Snippets
**Decision**: Provide full implementation code in sprint files
**Rationale**: Reduce ambiguity, ensure consistency
**Impact**: Faster implementation, fewer errors

### 3. Conservative Tolerances
**Decision**: Start with strict tolerances for reconciliation (1%, 0.1%)
**Rationale**: Safety first, tune based on production data
**Impact**: More alerts initially, but safer

### 4. In-Memory → Database/Redis
**Decision**: Implement in-memory first, migrate in Stream C
**Rationale**: Unblock other streams while infrastructure builds
**Impact**: Stream B can start before Stream C completes

### 5. Docker Compose for Development
**Decision**: Provide complete Docker setup for all services
**Rationale**: Consistent dev environment, easier onboarding
**Impact**: Faster setup, fewer environment issues

---

## 🚧 Known Limitations

### Stream Dependencies

While streams are independent, some optimizations require Stream C:
- Stream B uses in-memory cache until Stream C completes Redis
- Stream D needs database for historical reconciliation data
- Stream A can use database for trade history once Stream C done

**Solution**: All streams functional without database, enhanced after merge

### Testing Challenges

- **Exchange API**: Use testnet/sandbox, not live keys
- **Rate Limits**: Respect exchange limits during testing
- **Time-Based Tests**: Use short TTLs for cache expiration tests
- **Database Setup**: Requires PostgreSQL + TimescaleDB

### Resource Requirements

**Development Environment**:
- Docker with 4GB RAM minimum
- PostgreSQL 15 with TimescaleDB
- Redis 7
- Python 3.12+

**Production Environment**:
- 2GB RAM for Redis
- 10GB+ disk for PostgreSQL
- Monitoring tools (Grafana, Prometheus)

---

## 🔜 Next Steps

### After Sprint 1 Completion

1. **Integration Testing**: Merge all 4 streams, run full integration tests
2. **Performance Validation**: Confirm cache hit rates and cost savings
3. **Production Deployment**: Deploy to staging, then production
4. **Monitoring Setup**: Configure Grafana dashboards
5. **Alert Configuration**: Set up PagerDuty/Slack alerts

### Sprint 2 Planning

After Sprint 1 success, plan Sprint 2 with similar structure:
- Stream A: WebSocket stability & reconnection
- Stream B: Paper trading mode
- Stream C: Alerting system
- Stream D: Position state machine

**Total**: ~40 hours → 15 hours with parallelization
