## Key Insights & Recommendations

### Critical Success Factors

1. **Risk Management First** (Non-Negotiable)
   - 100% stop-loss adherence required
   - Multi-layered protection: exchange + app + emergency
   - Daily loss limit circuit breaker (-5% trigger)
   - Zero tolerance for positions without stop-loss

2. **Cost Control** (Budget Enforcement)
   - LLM budget: <$100/month (use Gemini Flash $8-12/month)
   - Token optimization: <1,000 tokens per prompt
   - Automatic model downgrade if budget at risk
   - Total operational cost: $108-245/month

3. **Reliability** (24/7 Operations)
   - System uptime: >99.5% required
   - WebSocket primary, REST fallback
   - Auto-reconnect with exponential backoff
   - Multi-layered monitoring

4. **Speed** (Latency Critical)
   - Decision latency: <2s target (680-1,730ms achievable)
   - Parallel processing for 6 cryptocurrencies
   - Async Python architecture
   - Database connection pooling

5. **Auditability** (Compliance)
   - Complete decision trail
   - Immutable audit logs
   - LLM reasoning captured
   - Trade reconciliation records

### Open Questions for Stakeholders

**Business Decisions**:
1. Initial capital allocation? (Assume $10,000-$50,000?)
2. Is -5% daily loss limit appropriate?
3. Which LLM models as primary/backup?
4. Trade 24/7 or pause during low liquidity?
5. Enable position replacement when limit reached?

**Technical Decisions**:
1. Primary exchange: Binance, Bybit, or multi-exchange?
2. Infrastructure: Self-hosted VPS or cloud (AWS/GCP/Azure)?
3. RTO/RPO for disaster recovery?
4. Monitoring: Custom dashboard or Grafana + Prometheus?
5. Paper trading duration: 7 days or longer?
