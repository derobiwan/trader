4. Review coverage mid-sprint and adjust

**Quality Improvements**:
1. Maintain excellent performance benchmarking approach
2. Continue security-first mindset (scan early and often)
3. Keep comprehensive documentation standards
4. Continue phased deployment strategy

**Risk Mitigation**:
1. Don't compromise on test coverage targets
2. Deploy production-ready components first
3. Monitor closely when deploying conditional components
4. Always have rollback plan ready
