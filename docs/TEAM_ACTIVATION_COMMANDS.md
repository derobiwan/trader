## ðŸŽ¯ Orchestrator Instructions

### Activation Sequence

1. **Immediate Launch (Day 1 Morning)**:
   - Activate Team Alpha and Team Bravo simultaneously
   - These teams work on the most critical components

2. **Day 2 Launch**:
   - Activate Team Charlie and Team Delta
   - Can begin while Alpha/Bravo are still working

3. **Day 3 Launch**:
   - Activate Team Echo
   - Begin integration test planning

### Coordination Points

- **Daily Sync**: Each team updates coverage metrics in dashboard
- **Blocker Resolution**: Escalate to Context Researcher if needed
- **Pattern Sharing**: Teams should reuse mock patterns
- **Integration Points**: Coordinate on shared dependencies

### Progress Monitoring

Check progress using:
```bash
# Run coverage report
pytest --cov=workspace --cov-report=term-missing

# Check specific file coverage
pytest --cov=workspace/features/trade_executor/executor_service --cov-report=term-missing

# View coverage HTML report
pytest --cov=workspace --cov-report=html
open htmlcov/index.html
```

### Quality Checkpoints

Before marking any team's work complete:
1. Run full test suite: `pytest workspace/tests/`
2. Verify coverage target met
3. Check for test flakiness (run 3x)
4. Review test quality and documentation
5. Ensure CI/CD passes

---

**Note**: Each validation engineer should work independently but coordinate on shared patterns and utilities. The goal is parallel execution with consistent quality.
