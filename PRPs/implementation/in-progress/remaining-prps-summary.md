## Implementation Sequencing

### Critical Path (Sequential - 8.5 weeks):
1. Database Setup →
2. Position Management →
3. Risk Manager →
4. Trade Executor →
5. Market Data Service →
6. Decision Engine →
7. Core Trading Loop →
8. Paper Trading

### Parallel Work Opportunities:
- Market Data Service || Technical Indicators
- LLM Integration || Prompt Engineering
- Monitoring Setup || Documentation
- Unit Tests || Integration Tests

## Key Risk Mitigations

### Technical Risks:
1. **Order Execution Failures**
   - Retry with exponential backoff
   - Fallback to market orders
   - Alert on repeated failures

2. **Position Discrepancies**
   - 5-minute reconciliation cycle
   - Automatic correction logic
   - Manual intervention alerts

3. **Stop-Loss Failures**
   - Three-layer protection
   - Exchange + System + Emergency
   - Guaranteed execution

4. **LLM Response Issues**
   - Safe default to "hold"
   - Validation before execution
   - Human-in-loop for anomalies

## Validation Gates for Each PRP

### Trade Executor Gates:
- [ ] Orders execute on testnet
- [ ] Position states tracked accurately
- [ ] Reconciliation identifies all discrepancies
- [ ] Retry mechanism works under load

### Risk Manager Gates:
- [ ] Stop-losses trigger at exact levels
- [ ] Circuit breaker closes all at -7%
- [ ] Position sizing follows Kelly Criterion
- [ ] Risk metrics calculate correctly

### Monitoring Gates:
- [ ] All metrics exported to Prometheus
- [ ] Dashboards show real-time data
- [ ] Alerts fire within 30 seconds
- [ ] Logs searchable and correlated

## Resource Requirements

### Development Environment:
- PostgreSQL 15+ with TimescaleDB
- Redis 7+
- Python 3.12+
- Docker for containerization
- Grafana + Prometheus stack

### Testing Environment:
- Bybit testnet account
- CHF 10,000 paper trading capital
- 7 days continuous operation
- Performance monitoring active

### Production Environment:
- VPS with 4 CPU, 8GB RAM
- 100GB SSD storage
- SSL certificates
