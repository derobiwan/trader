# Sprint 1: Foundation & Quick Wins

**Duration**: 5-7 days
**Goal**: Implement high-priority items and quick wins that enable production readiness
**Parallel Streams**: 4 independent work streams

---

## 🎯 Sprint Objectives

1. Enable real-time account balance and monitoring
2. Integrate caching to reduce API costs
3. Complete database and Redis infrastructure
4. Implement position reconciliation for production safety

## 📊 Parallel Work Streams

### Stream A: Quick Wins & Monitoring (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Agent**: Agent-A (Quick Wins Specialist)
**Duration**: 2-3 days
**Tasks**: 3 independent tasks
**Total Effort**: 7 hours
**Dependencies**: None

### Stream B: Caching Integration (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Agent**: Agent-B (Performance Optimizer)
**Duration**: 2-3 days
**Tasks**: 2 related tasks
**Total Effort**: 8 hours
**Dependencies**: None (CacheService already exists)

### Stream C: Database & Redis Infrastructure (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Agent**: Agent-C (Infrastructure Specialist)
**Duration**: 4-5 days
**Tasks**: 2 related tasks
**Total Effort**: 14 hours
**Dependencies**: None (can work independently)

### Stream D: Position Reconciliation (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Agent**: Agent-D (Trading Logic Specialist)
**Duration**: 3-4 days
**Tasks**: 1 complex task
**Total Effort**: 12 hours
**Dependencies**: None (models already exist)

## 📋 Task Distribution

| Stream | Tasks | Priority | Effort | Agent Type |
|--------|-------|----------|--------|------------|
| **A** | 3 quick wins | HIGH | 7h | Quick Wins |
| **B** | 2 caching | MEDIUM | 8h | Performance |
| **C** | 2 infrastructure | HIGH | 14h | Infrastructure |
| **D** | 1 reconciliation | HIGH | 12h | Trading Logic |

**Total Parallel Effort**: 41 hours (sequential would be 41h, parallel ~14h with 4 agents)

## 🔗 Inter-Sprint Dependencies

**Sprint 2 Dependencies**:
- Stream A completion enables → Sprint 2 Stream D (Alerting)
- Stream B completion enables → Sprint 2 Stream A (WebSocket caching)
- Stream C completion enables → Sprint 2 Stream C (Paper trading with real DB)
- Stream D completion enables → Sprint 2 Stream B (State machine)

**No blocking dependencies within Sprint 1** - all streams can work in parallel!

## ✅ Definition of Done (Sprint 1)

**Stream A**:
- [ ] Real-time balance fetching from exchange works
- [ ] Prometheus /metrics endpoint returns data
- [ ] Health check endpoints respond correctly
- [ ] All tests passing

**Stream B**:
- [ ] Market data cached with proper TTL
- [ ] LLM responses cached (duplicate prevention)
- [ ] Cache hit rate > 50% after 1 hour runtime
- [ ] Integration tests passing

**Stream C**:
- [ ] PostgreSQL schema migrations complete
- [ ] Redis connected and operational
- [ ] Connection pooling optimized
- [ ] Database queries under 10ms p95

**Stream D**:
- [ ] Position reconciliation detects discrepancies
- [ ] Auto-correction for minor differences
- [ ] Alert system for major discrepancies
- [ ] Reconciliation runs every 5 minutes

## 🚀 Getting Started

Each agent should:
1. Read this overview
2. Open their specific stream file
3. Run tests before starting: `pytest workspace/tests/ -v`
4. Work independently on their stream
5. Update their stream file with progress
6. Commit changes with clear messages
7. Create PR when stream is complete

**Communication**: Use separate branches:
- Stream A: `sprint-1/stream-a-quick-wins`
- Stream B: `sprint-1/stream-b-caching`
- Stream C: `sprint-1/stream-c-infrastructure`
- Stream D: `sprint-1/stream-d-reconciliation`
