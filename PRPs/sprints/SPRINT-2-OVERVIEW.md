# Sprint 2: Production Readiness & Risk Management

**Duration**: 5-7 days
**Goal**: Complete production deployment readiness with enhanced risk management
**Parallel Streams**: 4 independent work streams
**Prerequisites**: Sprint 1 complete and merged

---

## 🎯 Sprint Objectives

1. Ensure WebSocket stability for real-time data
2. Implement paper trading mode for safe testing
3. Complete alerting system for critical events
4. Enhance risk management with state machine

## 📊 Parallel Work Streams

### Stream A: WebSocket Stability & Reconnection (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Agent**: Agent-A (Implementation Specialist)
**Duration**: 3-4 days
**Tasks**: 2 related tasks
**Total Effort**: 12 hours
**Dependencies**: None

### Stream B: Paper Trading Mode (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Agent**: Agent-B (Implementation Specialist)
**Duration**: 3-4 days
**Tasks**: 2 related tasks
**Total Effort**: 14 hours
**Dependencies**: Database (from Sprint 1 Stream C)

### Stream C: Alerting System (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Agent**: Agent-C (DevOps Engineer)
**Duration**: 2-3 days
**Tasks**: 2 related tasks
**Total Effort**: 12 hours
**Dependencies**: Metrics (from Sprint 1 Stream A)

### Stream D: Position State Machine (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Agent**: Agent-D (Trading Logic Specialist)
**Duration**: 3-4 days
**Tasks**: 1 complex task
**Total Effort**: 10 hours
**Dependencies**: Position reconciliation (from Sprint 1 Stream D)

## 📋 Task Distribution

| Stream | Tasks | Priority | Effort | Agent Type |
|--------|-------|----------|--------|------------|
| **A** | 2 WebSocket | HIGH | 12h | Implementation |
| **B** | 2 Paper Trading | HIGH | 14h | Implementation |
| **C** | 2 Alerting | MEDIUM | 12h | DevOps |
| **D** | 1 State Machine | HIGH | 10h | Trading Logic |

**Total Parallel Effort**: 48 hours (sequential) → ~14-16 hours (parallel with 4 agents)

## 🔗 Inter-Sprint Dependencies

**Sprint 1 Outputs Used**:
- Stream A uses → Metrics from Sprint 1 Stream A
- Stream B uses → Database from Sprint 1 Stream C
- Stream C uses → Metrics from Sprint 1 Stream A, Infrastructure from Sprint 1 Stream C
- Stream D uses → Reconciliation from Sprint 1 Stream D

**No blocking dependencies within Sprint 2** - all streams can work in parallel!

## 🚀 Getting Started

Each agent should:
1. **Read Sprint 1 PR review** - Understand current state
2. **Read Sprint 2 overview** (this file)
3. **Read specific stream file** for your stream
4. **Verify Sprint 1 merged** - Ensure dependencies available
5. **Create branch**: `sprint-2/stream-x-name`
6. **Follow implementation steps** in order
7. **Test continuously**
8. **Create PR** when complete

**Communication**: Use separate branches:
- Stream A: `sprint-2/stream-a-websocket`
- Stream B: `sprint-2/stream-b-paper-trading`
- Stream C: `sprint-2/stream-c-alerting`
- Stream D: `sprint-2/stream-d-state-machine`
